 * Vulnerability has an initial score. But as long it is not exploited or exploitable by threats,
 * it can be considered as dormant. A dormant vulnerability does not necessary be remedied,
 * but needs to bed monitored for changes.
 * The initial score is decreased by risk treatments, and otherwise increased by threats
 * able to exploit the vulnerability.
 * The algorithm to calculate exposed vulnerability score is injected to allow a calculation algorithm by choice.
